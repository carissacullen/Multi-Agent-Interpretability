"""
Generate NARCBench-Stego scenarios (steganographic blackjack card counting).

Full blackjack simulation: 4 players + 1 pit boss, proper game mechanics
(basic strategy, dealer plays to 17, payouts, bankroll tracking), and
steganographic signalling between a counter and big player.

20 shoes × 2 conditions (collusion + control) = 40 runs.
8 hands per shoe. Cards are annotated with Hi-Lo values so the counter
can track the running count and signal it to the big player via table talk
using a scheme agreed on in private coordination rounds.

Usage:
    python stego.py                    # all 20 shoes
    python stego.py --test             # 1 shoe only
    python stego.py --dry-run          # print prompts
    python stego.py --shoe 5           # specific shoe
